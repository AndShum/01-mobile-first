### Help make our Blog web app mobile-first responsive!

## Getting started with pair programming

Take a moment to shake hands and introduce yourselves. You and your pair may have different experience levels, which is normal. You'll have opportunities to both teach and learn from your partner. Keep an open mind, and always be kind :)

The workflow may take a little getting used to, so give yourself time to work through any git issues (aka: "gituations") that arise.

**Take turns as 'driver' and 'navigator', alternating roles half-way (typically a couple TODOs or one hour, whichever arrives first).**

1. Driver forks and clones down this repo.
2. `cd` into the repo and open the starter-code folder in Atom.
3. Start by reviewing the existing code. What is our content? How are the semantics? Initial styles?
4. Search through the code for `TODO:` comments, where features should be, and incorporate the new code there.


## TODOs: MVP
  1. Set up the viewport and fluid media rules so content fits on mobile devices.
  1. Add a "Hamburger" menu button, that reveals the nav links when tapped on a mobile device.

## Stretch Goals:
  1. Use media queries to re-style the header and navigation on desktop-width screens. Nav should be tab-like links on one row.
