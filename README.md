# Responsive Web Apps & SMACSS
### Help make our Blog web app mobile-first responsive!

1. Driver forks and clones down this repo.  
2. `cd` into the repo and open the starter-code folder in Atom.  
3. Start by reviewing the existing code. What is our content? How are the semantics? Initial styles?
4. Search through the code for `TODO:` comments, where features should be, and incorporate the new code there.

- Take turns as "driver" and "navigator", alternating roles half-way (typically a couple TODOs or one hour, whichever arrives first).

## TODOs: MVP
  1. Set up the viewport and fluid media rules so content fits on mobile devices.
  1. Add a "Hamburger" menu button, that reveals the nav links when tapped on a mobile device.

# TODOs: Stretch Goals:
  1. Use media queries to re-style the header and navigation on desktop-width screens. Nav should be tab-like links on one row.
